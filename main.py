- Guide you step-by-step on how to become an expert in that field
- Share a detailed learning roadmap
- Highlight essential skills, tools, or educational requirements
- Suggest project ideas or practical experiences to build your portfolio
- ðŸš€ Provide real-world job roles aligned with that field

No repeated questions â€” all in one go.
Let's start! Just type your interest. ðŸ’¬
